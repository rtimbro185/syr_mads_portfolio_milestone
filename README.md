                                         	**IST - Portfolio Milestone**     

**Description:** <br>
For any technical leader, the knowledge and skills learned in Applied Data Science is a natural fit for the ever-increasing responsibilities placed on them. With the technology boom in Big Data, AI, and advancements in Data Mining techniques and tooling, most Companies are adopting the Data-Driven approach for running their organizations. In my field of technology management, to be a Leader, you have to be a hands-on technician, able to architect, design, and write code when necessary. 

Graduates of the MS Applied Data Science program at Syracuse University School of Information Studies, in collaboration with the Whitman School of Management, must be able to demonstrate that they have been able to master each fundamental aspect of this discipline, while also being able to synthesize their individual ability to analyze, interpret and recommend actions to stakeholders in organizations when challenged with new operational problems to solve.

The intent of this Portfolio Milestone is for the student to assemble evidence and reflect on how each course they have taken has contributed to their acquisition of the cognitive strategies defined in the program learning outcomes, and how this has enabled them to become professionally prepared in their chosen area of specialty. Within the Learning Objectives section of this document, the student will use references from their course projects or assignments and reflect on how their work has demonstrated their mastery of these concepts.
